# Recording

You can set up and launch recordings from the [Recorder window](RecorderWindow.md) or from a [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TimelineSection.html) track. In either case you can set the same properties, but how you set them varies.

- For information about recording from the Recorder window, see [Recording in Play mode](RecordingPlayMode.md)

- For information about recording from a Timeline track window, see [Recording from a Timeline track](RecordingTimelineTrack.md)
