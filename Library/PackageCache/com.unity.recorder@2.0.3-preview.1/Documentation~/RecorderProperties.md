# Setting Recorder properties

To configure a Recorder, set its properties in the [Recorder window](RecorderWindow.md) or, if you're recording from a Timeline Track, in the [Recorder Clip Inspector](RecordingTimelineTrack,md).

From there, you can set the following types of properties:

- **Output Properties:** These specify the name, path, and other data for files the Recorder outputs. These are described below.<br/><br/>
- **Recorder-specific properties:** Each type of Recorder has additional properties you must set. For example, a Recorder that captures via a Camera needs to know which Camera to use.<br/><br/>Recorder-specific properties are described on the following pages:
  - [**Configuring Animation Clip Recorders**](RecorderAnimation.md)
  - [**Configuring Movie Recorders**](RecorderMovie.md)
  - [**Configuring Image Sequence Recorders**](RecorderImage.md)
  - [**Configuring GIF Animation Recorders**](RecorderGif.md)
  - [**Configuring Audio Recorders**](RecorderAudio.md)

After you set the Recorder's properties, you can save them as a [Recorder Preset](RecorderManage.md#creating-recorder-presets).

If you've already saved the configuration you want as a [Recorder Preset](RecorderManage.md#creating-recorder-presets), you can load it instead of setting the Recorder properties.

>[!NOTE]
>Recorder properties are not available in standalone Unity Players or builds.

## Output properties

These properties define file output options for any type of Recorder.

|Property:||Function:|
|:---|:---|:---|
| **File Name** ||The name of the output file.<br/><br/>Type a file name in the text field.<br/><br/>Use the **+Wildcards** drop-down menu to choose various auto-generated strings to include in the file name. |
| **+Wildcards** ||Lists placeholders for auto-generated text strings that the Recorder inserts in the **File Name**. For example, the date and time you generate the recording.<br/><br/>Choose a wildcard from the drop-down menu to add its placeholder to the text field. You can combine wildcards.<br/><br/>The Recorder replaces all placeholders with the correct text when it saves the output file.|
|   | \<Recorder\>  |The Recorder name, as it appears in the Recorder list.  |   
|   |\<Time\>   | The time the recording is generated. Uses the `00h00m` format. |   
|   |\<Take\>   | The **Take Number** value. Uses the `000` format.  |   
|   |\<Date\>   | The date the recording is generated. Uses the `yyyy-MM-dd` format.   |   
|   |\<Project\>   | The name of the current Unity Project.  |   
|   |\<Product\>   | A combination of the Unity Project name and the output file extension.  |   
|   |\<Scene\>   | The name of the current Unity Scene.  |   
|   |\<Resolution\>   | The output resolution in pixels.  |   
|   |\<Frame\>   | The current frame.<br/><br/>This is useful for Image Sequence Recorders that output each frame as a separate file.  |   
|   |\<Extension\>   | The file extension of the output format.  |   
| **Path** ||Use these controls to configure the path to the folder where the Recorder saves output files.<br/><br/>Some Recorders can only output to specific locations. For example Animation Clip Recorders can only output to locations inside the Assets folder.|
|   |_[DROP-DOWN]_  |  Choose one of several pre-defined Unity folders, or choose **Absolute** to specify a custom path.  |
|   | _[TEXT FIELD]_  | If you choose a predefined path from the drop-down menu, the Recorder appends anything you enter here to that path.<br/><br/>If you choose **Absolute** from the drop-down menu, you can enter the custom output path here. <br/><br/> If you click the Output Location button (**...**) to choose an absolute path from the Unity file browser, the path you choose overwrites anything in this field. |
|   | Output Location button (**...**) | Opens a Unity file browser where you can choose a custom output path. When you choose a path this way, the Recorder automatically sets the drop-down menu to **Absolute**.  |
|   | _[PATH]_  | Displays the full output path, as set in the **File Name** and **Path** properties. |
|   | File Browser button <br/>![](Images/RecorderReveal.png)  | Opens your operating system's file browser to the current path.  |
|**Take Number**   || A value that the Recorder uses to number recordings. It increases by one after each recording. <br/><br/>You can use the **<Take>** wildcard to append current **Take** value to the **File Name**. |
