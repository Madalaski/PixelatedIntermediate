# The Recorder window

Use the Recorder window to manage Recorders and record Play-mode data .

Open the Recorder window from Unity's main menu (**Window > General > Recorder > Recorder window**).

When you open the **Recorder** window, Unity restores the values from the last recording session.

The Recorder window is not available in standalone Unity Players or builds.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are [recording from a Timeline track](RecordingTimelineTrack.md), you set up Recorders from the **Recorder Clip** properties instead.
